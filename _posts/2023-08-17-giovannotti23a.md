title: "Evaluating Machine Translation Quality with\r Conformal Predictive Distributions"
abstract: "This paper presents a new approach for assessing\r uncertainty in machine
  translation by simultaneously\r evaluating translation quality and providing a\r
  reliable confidence score.  Our approach utilizes\r conformal predictive distributions
  to produce\r prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage,\r meaning that for any
  given significance level\r $\\epsilon$, we can expect the true quality score of\r
  a translation to fall out of the interval at a rate\r of 1 - $\\epsilon$. In this
  paper, we demonstrate how\r our method outperforms a simple, but effective\r baseline
  on six different language pairs in terms of\r coverage and sharpness. Furthermore,
  we validate\r that our approach requires the data exchangeability\r assumption to
  hold for optimal performance."
