title: "PUNCC: a Python Library for Predictive Uncertainty\r Calibration and Conformalization"
abstract: "Predictive UNcertainty Calibration and\r Conformalization (PUNCC) is an
  open-source Python\r library integrating a collection of state-of-the-art\r Conformal
  Prediction (CP) algorithms and related\r techniques for regression and classi\fcation\r
  problems. This package aims to make conformal\r procedures accessible to non-experts
  using a simple\r and intuitive implementation. It is compatible with\r scikit-learn,
  PyTorch and TensorFlow and easily\r extensible to other prediction toolkits. PUNCC
  also\r comes with a low-level API that provides a unfi\fed\r workfow in a pythonic
  environment to build, combine\r and run inductive CP algorithms. It offers generic\r
  structures and consistent interfaces to design\r customized nonconformity scores,
  data partition\r schemes, and methods for constructing prediction\r sets.  In this
  paper, we present the design of our\r library and demonstrate its use with various
  CP\r procedures, Machine Learning (ML) problems and\r models from different ML libraries.
  \ Source code,\r documentation and demos are available at\r https://github.com/deel-ai/puncc."
