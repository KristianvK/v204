title: "Conformal Regression in Calorie Prediction for Team\r Jumbo-Visma"
abstract: "UCI WorldTour races, the premier menâ€™s elite road\r cycling tour, are grueling
  events that put physical\r fitness and endurance of riders to the test. The\r coaches
  of Team Jumbo-Visma have long been\r responsible for predicting the energy needs
  of each\r rider of the Dutch team for every race on the\r calendar. Those must be
  estimated to ensure riders\r have the energy and resources necessary to maintain\r
  a high level of performance throughout a race. This\r task, however, is both time-consuming
  and\r challenging, as it requires precise estimates of\r race speed and power output.
  Traditionally, the\r approach to predicting energy needs has relied on\r judgement
  and experience of coaches, but this method\r has its limitations and often leads
  to inaccurate\r predictions. In this paper, we propose a new, more\r effective approach
  to predicting energy needs for\r cycling races. By predicting the speed and power\r
  with regression models, we provide the coaches with\r calorie needs estimates for
  each individual rider\r per stage instantly. In addition, we compare methods\r to
  quantify uncertainty using conformal\r prediction. The empirical analysis of the\r
  jackknife+, jackknife-minmax,\r jackknife-minmax-after-bootstrap, CV+, CV-minmax,\r
  conformalized quantile regression, and inductive\r conformal prediction methods
  in conformal prediction\r reveals that all methods achieve valid prediction\r intervals.
  All but minmax-based methods also produce\r sufficiently narrow prediction
  intervals for\r decision-making. Furthermore, methods computing\r prediction intervals
  of fixed size produce tighter\r intervals for low significance values.  Among the\r
  methods computing intervals of varying length across\r the input space, inductive
  conformal prediction\r computes narrower prediction intervals at larger\r significance
  level."
