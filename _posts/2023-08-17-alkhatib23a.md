title: "Approximating Score-based Explanation Techniques\r Using Conformal Regression"
abstract: "Score-based explainable machine-learning techniques\r are often used to
  understand the logic behind\r black-box models. However, such explanation\r techniques
  are often computationally expensive,\r which limits their application in time-critical\r
  contexts. Therefore, we propose and investigate the\r use of computationally less
  costly regression models\r for approximating the output of score-based\r explanation
  techniques, such as SHAP. Moreover,\r validity guarantees for the approximated values
  are\r provided by the employed inductive conformal\r prediction framework. We propose
  several\r non-conformity measures designed to take the\r difficulty of approximating
  the explanations into\r account while keeping the computational cost low. We\r present
  results from a large-scale empirical\r investigation, in which the approximate explanations\r
  generated by our proposed models are evaluated with\r respect to efficiency (interval
  size). The results\r indicate that the proposed method can significantly\r improve
  execution time compared to the fast version\r of SHAP, TreeSHAP. The results also
  suggest that the\r proposed method can produce tight intervals, while\r providing
  validity guarantees. Moreover, the\r proposed approach allows for comparing explanations\r
  of different approximation methods and selecting a\r method based on how informative
  (tight) are the\r predicted intervals."
