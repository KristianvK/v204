title: "Flexible and Systematic Uncertainty Estimation with\r Conformal Prediction
  via the MAPIE library"
abstract: "Conformal prediction (CP) is an attractive\r theoretical framework for
  estimating the\r uncertainties of any predictive algorithms as its\r methodology
  is general and systematic with few\r assumptions. CP methods can be abstracted into\r
  building blocks that can be deployed on any type of\r data, model, or task. In this
  work, we contribute to\r the wide diffusion of the CP framework by developing\r
  the library MAPIE1 that implements such principles\r and can address seamlessly
  different tasks\r (e.g. classification, regression, time-series) and\r in different
  settings (split and\r cross-conformal). All these concepts are under a\r common
  umbrella with an emphasis on readability,\r transparency, and reliability, hence
  supporting the\r principles of trustworthy AI. An original feature of\r MAPIE is
  to offer the possibility of designing\r tailored-made non-conformity scores in particular\r
  p-normalized residual non-conformal scores that can\r be defined to account for
  asymmetric errors. We show\r theoretically the marginal coverage guarantee in\r
  several settings. We highlight through applications\r the interest of choosing different
  non-conformity\r scores for tabular data when considering local\r coverage."
