title: "An Uncertainty-Aware Sequential Approach for\r Predicting Response to Neoadjuvant
  Therapy in Breast\r Cancer"
abstract: "Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is considered the gold\r standard preoperative
  treatment for reducing tumor\r charge in breast cancer. However, the tumorâ€™s\r pathological
  response highly depends on patient\r conditions and clinical factors. There is a
  dire\r need to develop modeling tools to predict a patient\r response to NAT and
  thus improve personalized\r medical care plans. Recent studies have shown\r promising
  results of machine learning (ML)\r methodologies in breast cancer prognosis through
  the\r combination of several modalities, including imaging\r and molecular features
  derived from biopsy\r analyses. We here present a ML model to predict\r response
  to NAT through two sequential prediction\r stages. First, a pre-treatment dynamic\r
  contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging model\r is trained, followed by a second
  model with\r molecular biomarkers-enriched data. We propose the\r integration of
  the Conformal Prediction (CP)\r framework in the first non-invasive model to\r identify
  patients whose predicted responses show\r large uncertainty and refer them to the
  second model\r that includes data from invasive tests. The major\r advantage of
  this procedure is in the reduction of\r unnecessary biopsies. Different alternatives
  for the\r standard ML algorithms and the CP functions are\r explored on a publicly
  available clinical\r dataset. Results clearly show the potential of our\r uncertainty-aware
  clinical predictive tool in such\r real scenarios."
