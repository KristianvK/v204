title: "Applications of Conformal Regression on Real-world\r Industrial Use Cases
  using Crepes and MAPIE"
abstract: "Applying conformal prediction in real-world\r industrial use cases is rare,
  and publications are\r often limited to popular open-source data sets. This\r paper
  demonstrates two experimental use cases where\r the conformal prediction framework
  was applied to\r regression problems at Husqvarna Group with the two\r Python-based
  open-source platforms MAPIE and Crepes.\r The paper concludes by discussing lessons
  learned\r for the industry and some challenges for the\r conformal prediction community
  to address."
