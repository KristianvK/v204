title: "Applying the conformal prediction paradigm for the\r uncertainty quantification
  of an end-to-end\r automatic speech recognition model (wav2vec 2.0)"
abstract: "Uncertainty quantification is critical when using\r Automatic Speech Recognition
  (ASR) in High Risk\r Systems where safety is highly important. While\r developing
  ASR models adapted to such context, a\r range of techniques are being explored to
  measure\r the uncertainty of their predictions.  In this\r paper, we present two
  algorithms: the first one\r applies the Conformal Risk Control paradigm to\r predict
  a set of sentences that controls the Word\r Error Rate (WER) to an adjustable level
  of\r guarantee. The second algorithm uses Inductive\r Conformal Prediction (ICP)
  to predict uncertain\r words in an automatic transcription. We analyze the\r performance
  of the three algorithms using an\r open-source ASR model based on Wav2vec 2.0. The
  CP\r algorithms were trained on the “clean test” part of\r the LibriSpeech corpus
  that contains approximately\r 2,600 sentences. The results show that the three\r
  algorithms provide valid and efficient prediction\r sets. We guarantee that the
  WER is below 2% with a\r confidence level of 80% and an average set size of\r 29
  sentences and we detect 90% of the badly\r transcripted words."
