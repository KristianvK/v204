title: "Conformalized Adversarial Attack Detection for Graph\r Neural Networks"
abstract: "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved\r remarkable performance on
  diverse graph\r representation learning tasks. However, recent\r studies have unveiled
  their susceptibility to\r adversarial attacks, leading to the development of\r various
  defense techniques to enhance their\r robustness. In this work, instead of improving
  the\r robustness, we propose a framework to detect\r adversarial attacks and provide
  an adversarial\r certainty score in the prediction.  Our framework\r evaluates whether
  an input graph significantly\r deviates from the original data and provides a\r
  well-calibrated p-value based on this score through\r the conformal paradigm, therby
  controlling the false\r alarm rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\r approach
  on various benchmark datasets. Although we\r focus on graph classification, the
  proposed\r framework can be readily adapted for other\r graph-related tasks, such
  as node classification."
