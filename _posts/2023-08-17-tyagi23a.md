title: "Multi-label Classification under Uncertainty: A\r Tree-based Conformal Prediction
  Approach"
abstract: "Multi-label classification is a common challenge in\r various machine learning
  applications, where a\r single data instance can be associated with multiple\r classes
  simultaneously. The current paper proposes a\r novel tree-based method for multi-label\r
  classification using conformal prediction and\r multiple hypothesis testing. The
  proposed method\r employs hierarchical clustering with labelsets to\r develop a
  hierarchical tree, which is then\r formulated as a multiple-testing problem with
  a\r hierarchical structure. The split-conformal\r prediction method is used to obtain
  marginal\r conformal p-values for each tested hypothesis, and\r two hierarchical
  testing procedures are developed\r based on marginal conformal p-values, including
  a\r hierarchical Bonferroni procedure and its\r modification for controlling the
  family-wise error\r rate. The prediction sets are thus formed based on\r the testing
  outcomes of these two procedures. We\r establish a theoretical guarantee of valid
  coverage\r for the prediction sets through proven family-wise\r error rate control
  of those two procedures. We\r demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a\r
  simulation study and two real data analysis compared\r to other conformal methods
  for multi-label\r classification."
