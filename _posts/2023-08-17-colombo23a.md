title: On training locally adaptive CP
abstract: "We address the problem of making Conformal\r Prediction (CP) intervals
  locally adaptive.  Most\r existing methods focus on approximating the\r object-conditional
  validity of the intervals by\r partitioning or re-weighting the calibration\r set.
  Our strategy is new and conceptually\r different. Instead of re-weighting the calibration\r
  data, we redefine the conformity measure through a\r trainable change of variables,
  A â†’ $\\phi$X(A), that\r depends explicitly on the object attributes,\r X. Under
  certain conditions and if $\\phi$X is\r monotonic in A for any X, the transformations\r
  produce prediction intervals that are guaranteed to\r be marginally valid and have
  X-dependent sizes. We\r describe how to parameterize and train $\\phi$X to\r maximize
  the interval efficiency. Contrary to other\r CP-aware training methods, the objective
  function is\r smooth and can be minimized through standard\r gradient methods without
  approximations."
