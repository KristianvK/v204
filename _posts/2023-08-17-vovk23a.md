title: "The power of forgetting in statistical hypothesis\r testing"
abstract: "This paper places conformal testing in a general\r framework of statistical
  hypothesis testing.  A\r standard approach to testing a composite null\r hypothesis
  H is to test each of its elements and to\r reject H when each of its elements is
  rejected. It\r turns out that we can fully cover conformal testing\r using this
  approach only if we allow forgetting some\r of the data. However, we will see that
  the standard\r approach covers conformal testing in a weak\r asymptotic sense and
  under restrictive\r assumptions. I will also list several possible\r directions
  of further research, including developing\r a general scheme of online testing."
