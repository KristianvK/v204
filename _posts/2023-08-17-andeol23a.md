title: "Confident Object Detection via Conformal Prediction\r and Conformal Risk Control:
  an Application to\r Railway Signaling"
abstract: "Deploying deep learning models in real-world\r certi\fed systems requires
  the ability to provide\r con\fdence estimates that accurately reflect their\r uncertainty.
  In this paper, we demonstrate the use\r of the conformal prediction framework to
  construct\r reliable and trustworthy predictors for detecting\r railway signals.
  Our approach is based on a novel\r dataset that includes images taken from the\r
  perspective of a train operator and state-of-the-art\r object detectors. We test
  several conformal\r approaches and introduce a new method based on\r conformal risk
  control. Our fi\fndings demonstrate\r the potential of the conformal prediction
  framework\r to evaluate model performance and provide practical\r guidance for achieving
  formally guaranteed\r uncertainty bounds."
