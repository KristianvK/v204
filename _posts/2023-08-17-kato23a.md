title: "A Review of Nonconformity Measures for Conformal\r Prediction in Regression"
abstract: "Conformal prediction provides distribution-free\r uncertainty quantification
  under minimal\r assumptions. An important ingredient in conformal\r prediction is
  the so-called nonconformity measure,\r which quantifies how the test sample differs
  from\r the rest of the data. In this paper, existing\r nonconformity measures from
  the current literature\r are collected and their underlying ideas are\r analyzed.
  Furthermore, the influence of different\r factors on the performance of conformal
  prediction\r are pointed out by focusing on the relation between\r the influencing
  factors and the choice of\r nonconformity measures. Lastly, we provide\r suggestions
  for future work with regard to currently\r existing knowledge gaps and development
  of new\r nonconformity measures."
