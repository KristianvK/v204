title: "Conformal Association Rule Mining (CARM): A novel\r technique for data error
  detection and probabilistic\r correction"
abstract: "Conformal prediction (CP) is a modern framework for\r reliable machine
  learning. It is most commonly used\r in the context of supervised learning, where
  in\r combination with an underlying algorithm it\r generates predicted labels for
  new, unlabelled\r examples and complements each of them with an\r individual measure
  of confidence. Conversely,\r association rule mining (ARM) is an unsupervised\r
  learning technique for discovering interesting\r relationships in large datasets
  in the form of\r rules. In this work, we integrate CP and ARM to\r develop a novel
  technique termed Conformal\r Association Rule Mining (CARM). The technique\r enables
  the identification of probable errors within\r a set of binary labels. Subsequently,
  these probable\r errors are analysed using another modern framework\r called Venn-ABERS
  prediction to correct the value in\r a probabilistic way."
