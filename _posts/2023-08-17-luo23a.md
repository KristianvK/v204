title: "Anomalous Edge Detection in Edge Exchangeable Social\r Network Models"
abstract: "This paper studies detecting anomalous edges in\r directed graphs that
  model social networks.  We\r exploit edge exchangeability as a criterion for\r distinguishing
  anomalous edges from normal\r edges. Then we present an anomaly detector based on\r
  conformal prediction theory; this detector has a\r guaranteed upper bound for false
  positive rate. In\r numerical experiments, we show that the proposed\r algorithm
  achieves superior performance to baseline\r methods."
