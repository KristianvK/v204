title: Conformal Credal Self-Supervised Learning
abstract: "In semi-supervised learning, the paradigm of\r self-training refers to
  the idea of learning from\r pseudo-labels suggested by the learner\r itself. Recently,
  corresponding methods have proven\r effective and achieve state-of-the-art performance,\r
  e.g., when applied to image classification\r problems. However, pseudo-labels typically
  stem from\r ad-hoc heuristics, relying on the quality of the\r predictions though
  without guaranteeing their\r validity. One such method, so-called credal\r self-supervised
  learning, maintains\r pseudo-supervision in the form of sets of (instead\r of single)
  probability distributions over labels,\r thereby allowing for a flexible yet\r uncertainty-aware
  labeling. Again, however, there is\r no justification beyond empirical effectiveness.
  To\r address this deficiency, we make use of conformal\r prediction, an approach
  that comes with guarantees\r on the validity of set-valued predictions. As a\r result,
  the construction of credal sets of labels is\r supported by a rigorous theoretical
  foundation,\r leading to better calibrated and less error-prone\r supervision for
  unlabeled data. Along with this, we\r present effective algorithms for learning
  from\r credal self-supervision. An empirical study\r demonstrates excellent calibration
  properties of the\r pseudo-supervision, as well as the competitiveness\r of our
  method on several image classification\r benchmark datasets."
