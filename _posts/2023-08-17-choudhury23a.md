title: "Evaluating potential sensitive information leaks on\r a smartphone using the
  magnetometer and Conformal\r Prediction"
abstract: "The low powered sensors used in modern Smartphones\r do not require permissions
  when using low sampling\r rates i.e. 200Hz and below. This has made them a\r target
  for side channel attacks. In this paper we\r perform a series of experiments that
  harvest raw\r data from the low powered sensor known as the\r magnetometer. We start
  by using unsupervised\r learning with the cosine metric to provide clear\r indications
  if it is possible to classify the data\r into the different security events occurring
  at the\r time of capture. We then build a model, designed to\r be robust in terms
  of the orientation of the device,\r to evaluate the risk of sensitive data being\r
  correctly identified from magnetometer data despite\r the limited sampling rate.
  Using a model trained\r with LSTM on the whole data set with an 80/20 split,\r our
  results show 100% accuracy on our reverse\r Turing test and 67.5% on the key press
  test.  We\r also show that when analysing the captured\r magnetometer responses
  to playing sound samples from\r the loudspeaker it is very difficult to infer the\r
  original sound. We extend the work using Inductive\r Conformal Prediction by examining
  the property of\r uncertainty for different confidence levels. We also\r show that
  despite a high degree of uncertainty there\r is the potential to infer security
  properties such\r as the layout of a screen. To this end we show that\r the number
  5 in the center of a keypad occurs a\r disproportionately high number of times in
  the\r prediction set (68.3%)."
