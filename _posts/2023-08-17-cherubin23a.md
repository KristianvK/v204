title: "How do the performance of a Conformal Predictor and\r its underlying algorithm
  relate?"
abstract: "Conformal Prediction (CP) offers a shift on the\r traditional supervised
  classification\r paradigm. Whereas in supervised learning one\r generally aims to
  optimize the error of a classifier\r at predicting the label correctly (prediction\r
  error), in CP one aims to optimize the size of a\r prediction set (efficiency),
  where this set is\r guaranteed to contain the true label with\r probability $\\geq
  1-\\varepsilon$, for a user-defined\r $\\varepsilon \\in[0,1]$. CP works as a wrapper
  around\r a traditional learning model; yet, it is unclear how\r the prediction error
  of the underlying model affects\r the efficiency of the CP. In this note, we study
  a\r simple class of CPs whose efficiency is proportional\r to the prediction error
  of the underlying model."
