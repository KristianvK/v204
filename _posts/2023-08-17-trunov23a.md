title: Online aggregation of conformal predictive systems
abstract: "The problem of online probabilistic forecasting is\r considered. Probabilistic
  forecasts are obtained as\r a result of the application of conformal predictive\r
  systems. The conformal predictive system is a novel\r method for obtaining reliable
  predictions which are\r based on point forecasts of the regression\r algorithm.
  The paper considers the case when at each\r moment of time several competing conformal\r
  predictive systems (experts) give their predictions\r in the form of probability
  distribution\r functions. Probabilistic forecasts of the experts\r are combined
  by an aggregation algorithm into one\r probabilistic forecast at each step of the\r
  forecasting process, while expert forecasts can be\r used partially.  The developed
  methods are used to\r solve the well-known problem of predicting the load\r of an
  electrical network online. Numerical\r experiments have shown the agreement of predictions\r
  with real data."
