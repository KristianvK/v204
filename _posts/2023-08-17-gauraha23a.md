title: "Investigating the Contribution of Privileged\r Information in Knowledge Transfer
  LUPI by\r Explainable Machine Learning"
abstract: "Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) is a\r framework that exploits
  information that is\r available during training only, i.e., the privileged\r information
  (PI), to improve the classification of\r objects for which this information is not\r
  available. Knowledge transfer LUPI (KT-LUPI) extends\r the framework by inferring
  PI for the test objects\r through separate predictive models. Although the\r effectiveness
  of the framework has been thoroughly\r demonstrated, current investigations have
  provided\r limited insights only regarding what parts of the\r transferred PI contribute
  to the improved\r performance. A better understanding of this could\r not only lead
  to computational savings but\r potentially also to novel strategies for exploiting\r
  PI. We approach the problem by exploring the use of\r explainable machine learning
  through the\r state-of-the-art technique SHAP, to analyze the\r contribution of
  the transferred privileged\r information. We present results from experiments\r
  with five classification and three regression\r datasets, in which we compare the
  Shapley values of\r the PI computed in two different settings; one where\r the PI
  is assumed to be available during both\r training and testing, hence representing
  an ideal\r scenario, and a second setting, in which the PI is\r available during
  training only but is transferred to\r test objects, through KT-LUPI. The results
  indicate\r that explainable machine learning indeed has the\r potential as a tool
  to gain insights regarding the\r effectiveness of KT-LUPI."
