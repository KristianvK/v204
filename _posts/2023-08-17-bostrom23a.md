title: Mondrian Predictive Systems for Censored Data
abstract: "Conformal predictive systems output predictions in\r the form of well-calibrated
  cumulative distribution\r functions (conformal predictive distributions). In\r this
  paper, we apply conformal predictive systems to\r the problem of time-to-event prediction,
  where the\r conformal predictive distribution for a test object\r may be used to
  obtain the expected time until an\r event occurs, as well as p-values for an event
  to\r take place earlier (or later) than some specified\r time points. Specifically,
  we target right-censored\r time-to-event prediction tasks, i.e., situations in\r
  which the true time-to-event for a particular\r training example may be unknown
  due to observation\r of the example ending before any event occurs. By\r leveraging
  the Kaplan-Meier estimator, we develop a\r procedure for constructing Mondrian predictive\r
  systems that are able to produce well-calibrated\r cumulative distribution functions
  for right-censored\r time-to-event prediction tasks. We show that the\r proposed
  procedure is guaranteed to produce\r conservatively valid predictive distributions,
  and\r provide empirical support using simulated censoring\r on benchmark data. The
  proposed approach is\r contrasted with established techniques for survival\r analysis,
  including random survival forests and\r censored quantile regression forests, using
  both\r synthetic and non-synthetic censoring."
