title: "Evaluation of conformal-based probabilistic\r forecasting methods for short-term
  wind speed\r forecasting"
abstract: "We apply Conformal Predictive Distribution Systems\r (CPDS) and a non-exchangeable
  version of the\r traditional Conformal Prediction (NECP) method to\r short-term
  wind speed forecasting to generate\r probabilistic forecasts. These are compared
  to the\r more traditional Quantile Regression Forest (QRF)\r method. A short-term
  forecast is available from a\r few hours before the forecasted time period and is\r
  only extended a couple days into the future.  The\r methods are supplied ensemble
  forecasts as input and\r additionally the Conformal methods are supplied with\r
  post-processed point forecasts for generating the\r probability distributions. In
  the NECP case we\r propose a method of producing probability\r distributions by
  creating sequentially larger\r prediction intervals. The methods are compared\r
  through a teaching schedule, to mimic a real-world\r setting. For each model update
  in the teaching\r schedule a grid-search approach is applied to select\r each method’s
  optimal hyperparameters, respectively.\r The methods are tested out of the box with
  tweaks to\r few hyperparameters. We also introduce a normalized\r nonconformity
  score and use it with the conformal\r method that handles data that violates the\r
  exchangeability assumption. The resulting\r probability distributions are compared
  to actual\r wind measurements through Continuous Ranked\r Probability Scores (CRPS)
  as well as their validity\r and efficiency of certain prediction intervals.  Our\r
  results suggest that the conformal based methods,\r with the pre-trained underlying
  model, produce\r slightly more conservative but more efficient\r probability distributions
  than QRF at a lower\r computational cost. We further propose how the\r conformal-based
  methods could be improved for the\r application to real-world scenarios. "
