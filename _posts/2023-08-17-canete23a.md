title: Market Implied Conformal Volatility Intervals
abstract: "Volatility is a fundamental input for pricing and\r risk management of
  \fnancial instruments.  In the\r following work we propose an algorithm to estimate\r
  the market implied uncertainty of future realized\r volatility. Our method interprets
  the market implied\r volatility as a point prediction of future realized\r volatility
  and applies online conformal prediction\r to estimate the uncertainty of this prediction.
  We\r analyze rolling coverage and width of several\r nonconformity scores over 15
  years of daily\r data. The results suggest that conformal prediction\r can be used
  to infer market implied prediction\r intervals for realized volatility.  "
