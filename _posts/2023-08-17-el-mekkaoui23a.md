title: "Neural Networks based Conformal Prediction for\r Pipeline Structural Response"
abstract: "The widespread use of machine learning models has\r achieved considerable
  success across various\r domains. Nevertheless, their deployment in\r safety-critical
  systems can result in catastrophic\r consequences if uncertainties are not handled\r
  properly. This study is concerned with the\r simulation of the physical response
  of a subsea\r pipeline when it is hooked by an anchor. Predicting\r this response
  is crucial for risk assessment,\r however, it is computationally unfeasible to run
  a\r significant amount of input sets to compute the\r probability of failure of
  the system. Therefore, the\r use of a surrogate model becomes essential. In this\r
  context, a surrogate model is a machine learning\r model trained on data from a
  physicsbased\r simulation. This is achieved by neural network based\r surrogate
  models, as they are capable of modelling\r complex relationships and provide greater
  accuracy\r than other machine learning models in many use\r cases. However, to ensure
  the safe use of these\r models, it is important to understand the\r uncertainty
  associated with their\r predictions. Therefore, we apply the conformal\r prediction
  framework to provide valid prediction\r intervals and improve the uncertainty quantification\r
  of the neural network models. In order to create\r adaptive conformal prediction
  intervals, we employ\r multilayer perceptron neural network models that\r provide
  uncertainty estimates through both the Monte\r Carlo dropout technique and treating
  the output as a\r Gaussian distribution, with the neural network\r providing estimates
  for both mean and variance. The\r conformal prediction procedure improves the\r
  uncertainty estimation of uncalibrated models and\r guarantees new test samples
  are within the predicted\r intervals with the corresponding selected confidence\r
  level."
