title: "Confidence Classifiers with Guaranteed Accuracy or\r Precision"
abstract: "In many situations, probabilistic predictors have\r replaced conformal
  classifiers. The main reason is\r arguably that the set predictions of conformal\r
  classifiers, with the accompanying significance\r level, are hard to interpret.
  In this paper, we\r demonstrate how conformal classification can be used\r as a
  basis for a classifier with reject\r option. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate
  two\r algorithms that are able to perfectly estimate\r accuracy or precision for
  a set of test instances,\r in a classifier with reject scenario. In the\r empirical
  investigation, the suggested algorithms\r are shown to clearly outperform both calibrated
  and\r uncalibrated probabilistic predictors."
