title: Self Learning using Venn-Abers predictors
abstract: "In supervised learning problems, it is common to\r have a lot of unlabeled
  data, but little labeled\r data. It is then desirable to leverage the unlabeled\r
  data to improve the learning procedure. One way to\r do this is to have a model
  predict “pseudolabels”\r for the unlabeled data, so as to use them for\r learning.
  In self-learning, the pseudo-labels are\r provided by the very same model to which
  they are\r fed. As these pseudo-labels are by nature uncertain\r and only partially
  reliable, it is then natural to\r model this uncertainty and take it into account
  in\r the learning process, if only to robustify the\r self-learning procedure. This
  paper describes such\r an approach, where we use Venn-Abers Predictors to\r produce
  calibrated credal labels so as to quantify\r the pseudo-labeling uncertainty. These
  labels are\r then included in the learning process by optimizing\r an adapted loss.
  Experiments show that taking into\r account pseudo-label uncertainty both robustifies\r
  the self-learning procedure and allows it to\r converge faster in general."
