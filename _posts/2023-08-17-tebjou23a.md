title: "Data-driven Reachability using Christoffel Functions\r and Conformal Prediction"
abstract: "An important mathematical tool in the analysis of\r dynamical systems is
  the approximation of the reach\r set, i.e., the set of states reachable after a
  given\r time from a given initial state.  This set is\r difficult to compute for
  complex systems even if the\r system dynamics are known and given by a system of\r
  ordinary differential equations with known\r coefficients. In practice, parameters
  are often\r unknown and mathematical models difficult to\r obtain. Data-based approaches
  are promised to avoid\r these difficulties by estimating the reach set based\r on
  a sample of states. If a model is available, this\r training set can be obtained
  through numerical\r simulation. In the absence of a model, real-life\r observations
  can be used instead. A recently\r proposed approach for data-based reach set\r approximation
  uses Christoffel functions to\r approximate the reach set. Under certain\r assumptions,
  the approximation is guaranteed to\r converge to the true solution. In this paper,
  we\r improve upon these results by notably improving the\r sample efficiency and
  relaxing some of the\r assumptions by exploiting statistical guarantees\r from conformal
  prediction with training and\r calibration sets. In addition, we exploit an\r incremental
  way to compute the Christoffel function\r to avoid the calibration set while maintaining
  the\r statistical convergence guarantees. Furthermore, our\r approach is robust
  to outliers in the training and\r calibration set."
