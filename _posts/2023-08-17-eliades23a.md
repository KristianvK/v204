title: "A Conformal Martingales Ensemble Approach for\r addressing Concept Drift"
abstract: "We propose an ensemble learning approach to tackle\r the problem of concept
  drift (CD) in data-stream\r classi\fcation. Accurately detecting the change\r point
  in the distribution is insufficient to ensure\r precise predictions, particularly
  when the selection\r of a representative training set is challenging or\r computationally
  expensive. More speci\fcally, we\r employ an ensemble of ten classi\fers that use
  a\r majority voting mechanism to make predictions. To\r promote diversity among
  models, we train each on a\r different number of instances, resulting in\r different
  sequences of p-values and construct an\r Inductive Conformal Martingale (ICM) for
  each\r one. When the ICM algorithm detects a change point\r in the corresponding
  p-value sequence, we perform a\r retraining process of the corresponding\r classi\fer.
  We evaluate the performance of our\r proposed methodology on four benchmark datasets
  and\r compare it to existing methods in the\r literature. Our experimental results
  show that the\r proposed approach exhibits comparable and in some\r cases better
  accuracy than two state-of-the-art\r algorithms."
